# flask_neo4j_blog
A webapp developed just to learn to use neo4j and flask and deployed to heroku.
The app is a very simple blog which allows users to register, login, create posts, see similar users and like other users posts.
It uses graph db (neo4j) and is based on safaribooksonline.com course "BUILDING WEB APPS USING FLASK AND NEO4J"
